        <h1>What is the Impact of Working from Home on the Environment?</h1>

        <h2>The History of Working From Home</h2>
        <p>Working from home is nothing new in America. Hilary Silver, a Professor of Sociology at Brown University, lists a few of the ways work and home have been connected for centuries in her 2023 article. &#x0022Employers build worker housing, small businesspeople live above the store, and generations of women take in piecework while tending to their families. The family farm persists.&#x0022</p>
        <p>However, there was a noticeable increase in working from home in the 1980s due to advances in information technology. The coronavirus pandemic also coincided with an increase in homework, but that change has since faded.</p>
        <p>An important caveat on any exploration of homework&#8217s environmental impact is the estimate that only 37% of jobs in the U.S. could be performed at home. Therefore there would need to be significant changes made to the labor market before a mass shift to homework could be made, even if it was found to bring a net benefit to the environment.</p>
        <h2>The Impact of Commutes</h2>
        <p>The most obvious impact of working from home is a decrease in commutes. Reduced greenhouse gas emissions was the most significant benefit found by Earth.Org, an organization that informs the public about what they can do to protect the environment. An article on their website by April Miller cited data from Breathe London. The data showed that the beginning of covid lockdowns coincided with an emissions reduction of 25% during morning commutes, and 34% during evening commutes.</p>
        <p>However, some could argue that the development of public transportation systems could have a similar effect.</p>
        <h2>Comparing Office and Residential Utilities</h2>
        <p>When it comes to utilities, work from home does not have any decisive advantage over office buildings. The Harvard Business review analyzed multiple studies, and found that the conclusions ranged from positive to neutral to negative. It does stand to reason that supplying multiple separate buildings with energy throughout the day is not necessarily more efficient that supplying one large office building.</p>
        <p>One could argue that a focus on increased renewable energy production would have a more significant net benefit impact.</p>
        <h2>Technological Redundancy</h2>
        <p>In order to work from home, the vast majority of workers choose to buy more technology. This might include monitors, webcams, microphones, or a nicer computer. Along with its energy expenditure findings, the Harvard Business review commented that employees spend longer on electronic devices when communicating in person is not an option. The article also pointed out the issue of companies sending employees laptops during the covid pandemic, without first checking to make sure that they were not sending their workers an unnecessary device.</p>
        <p>The world could generally use more efficient systems for the recycling of batteries, rare earths, and other components of electronics. This would decrease the need for mining, and the pollution that these products can cause in landfills.</p>
        <h2>Is Virtual or Office Work Better for the Earth?</h2>
        <p>In the end, it is unclear that homework provides any significant benefit for the environment. Other advancements, such as public transportation, increases in renewable energy, and electronics recycling programs, could have a much more significant impact.
